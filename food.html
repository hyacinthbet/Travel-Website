                            <p class = "text">Often regarded as the national dish of the Philippines, this pre-colonial dish (and cooking method) incorporates meat, seafood, or vegetables in a mixture of vinegar, soy sauce, black peppercorn, bay leaves, and garlic. Simmered over low heat for a few hours, the meat breaks down and helps create a flavorful (and typically thick) sauce. While chicken adobo is adored across the Philippines, multiple regional variations exist, including adobo sa gata from Southern Luzon, which includes coconut milk and chilis for richness and spice.</p>

                            <p class = "text">Much of the daily Filipino diet consists of soups and stews, and sinigang is a traditional favorite Filipino food, perfect for warming up on a chilly day. Sinigang is a category of sour stews that can be made with pork, fish, shrimp or beef and a variety of vegetables like taro, green beans, tomatoes, onions and more. The key ingredient in any sinigang recipe is a souring agent, usually sourced from fruits like tamarind, guava, santol or kamias. Depending on the main ingredients, sinigang may be called different names, like sinigang na hipon or sinigang na baboy.</p>

                            <p class = "text">Served on a sizzling plate with plenty of rice, pork sisig is one of the most popular drinking foods in the Philippines. The funky, iron-rich dish consists of chopped pork head, pig ears, chicken liver, and onions—the entirety of which is boiled and grilled, then seasoned with vinegar and citrus juice. While sisig originally came from Pampanga in Central Luzon, variations abound across the archipelago, including crocodile sisig from Palawan, the country’s easternmost island.</p>

                            <p class = "text">Tinola is a classic Filipino food with a fragrant and zingy flavor. Individual family recipes may vary, but tinola is usually made with chicken, fish sauce, green papaya or chayote, onions, ginger, garlic, moringa and chili pepper leaves. Like niligang baka, tinola is an awesome dish to have when you need an immune boost. The broth itself is light enough to comfort upset stomachs, while the fragrant ginger, garlic and chili pepper leaves soothe congestion.</p>

                            <p class = "text">Dinuguan is a traditional savory stew made with chunks of pork meat or pork offal, but it’s the broth base of this Filipino food that piques many people’s interest. The root word of dinuguan is dugo, which translates to “blood.” As the name might suggest, dinuguan stew is simmered with a broth of pig’s blood, vinegar, chili and garlic, giving it an intense and savory flavor with some classic sour notes. This dark and hearty Filipino food goes by many other names throughout the Philippine islands, such as dinardaraan, sinugaok, tid tad or even jokingly, “chocolate stew.” To balance its bold flavor, dinuguan is often served as an entrée over white rice.</p>

                            <p class = "text">Lechon is one of the Philippines' most well-known foods whose name translates to “roasted piglet.” However, this dish isn’t usually made with piglets, rather with one fully-grown pig, lightly seasoned and roasted whole. Part of what makes lechon so world-famous is its striking visual appearance. The entire pig is spit-roasted after having been cleaned and stuffed, creating a huge and golden-brown meat dish that retains its original piggy shape. Lechon is considered a delicacy food, and it is most often served at big celebrations like weddings, holidays and festivals. </p>
